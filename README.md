Plays audio streams from a TVHeadend server

## About
This skill plays a channel from a TVHeadend server, using the audio profile (this means that the video on TV channels is not streamed or decoded). The user can enter aliases for up to five channels to make it easier to request these channels.

## Examples
* "Play BBC Radio 2" (where 'BBC Radio 2' is the name of a channel)
* "Play local radio" (where 'local radio' is an alias for a channel)
* "Play Capital radio" (where the channel is called 'Capital')
